## About ```paint.io```

I created this simple project for fun. The main idea was to write my version of [Ask.fm](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.fm), which was popular in my childhood. But ```paint.io``` is made more for _describing you to your friends_. The algorithm of actions is such that the user can create any number of boards, shares his board on social networks where his friends write comments about him completely anonymously
